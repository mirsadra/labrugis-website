          In a world full of fleeting beauty trends and overblown promises,{" "}
          <strong>Labrugis</strong> was created with a different purpose. Born
          from the minds of pharmacists and healthcare professionals, we set out
          to create skincare that is rooted in science, shaped by compassion and
          powered by integrity.

          Our name, <strong>Labrugis</strong>, is more than a label. Inspired by
          the Dutch word <em>Brug</em> (pronounced <em>Broozh</em>, ⁄ò), meaning{" "}
          <em>bridge</em>, it reflects who we are and what we stand for. We aim
          to be the bridge between the lab and your skin. Between research and
          real life. Between what works and what feels right.

          Every Labrugis product begins in the lab, not in a marketing meeting.
          We are a collective of scientifically trained minds who believe that
          skincare should be backed by evidence, not empty claims. With our
          pharmaceutical backgrounds, we take pride in developing formulas that
          are both safe and effective, with each ingredient chosen for a reason,
          not for a trend.

        <p className="mt-2">
          Although we are in the early stages of development, our vision is
          built on years of healthcare experience, research knowledge and a
          commitment to high standards.
